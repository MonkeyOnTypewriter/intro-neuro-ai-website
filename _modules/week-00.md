### Assignment

***IMPORTANT!:*** **If you already know a topic, DO NOT waste your time re-doing it. This week is just to refresh your mind**

**That being said, if you are unfamiliar with most of the items here, focus on Python and be sure to ask lots of questions!**

Python Assignments:
- Complete units in the CS50x Intro to Python Course **as needed** (If you are confident, feel free to skip a section). I recommend:
    - 0: Functions, Variables
    - 1: Conditionals
    - 2: Loops
    - 4: Libraries
    - 9: Et Cetera
- Read through CS231n Notes, focusing on:
    - Containers
    - Numpy
    - MatPlotLib

Math Assignments:
- Read/Watch provided resources to learn/refresh your math knowledge. 
- If you are already familiar with the concepts listed above, feel free to skip them. I would, however, reccomend you explore linear algebra in high dimensional spaces (specifically **hyperplanes**) and revisit **partial derivatives**.

### Summary Questions
