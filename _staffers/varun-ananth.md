Hey there! My name is Varun. I have been working on this course for a while and with the help of some amazing people, it came together. I really believe in the power of education and teaching and how it can shape lives. I attribute my successes today to my teachers, peer or adult. With this course I aim to spark interest for Neuro/AI in college students around the world. My specialty within DL is Reinforcement Learning, and I hope to be able to continue research in that field. Apart from nerdy stuff, I enjoy guitar, skateboarding, and videogames. So basically more nerdy stuff.
