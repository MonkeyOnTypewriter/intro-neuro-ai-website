# Megadoc

Hello, and welcome to the i2 Neuro/AI Megadoc. Here you can find all sorts of resources designed to help YOU become an amazing Neuro/AI* researcher!

How to use (ignore if following curriculum):
* Take a look at the table of contents and get a sense for what you do/don’t know
    * Start from the beginning if you are brand new OR
    * Pick a topic that looks interesting!
* For each major topic we have linked [Resources](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resource), `Questions`, and sometimes a mini-project **that will take you to our project repo**!
* Be sure to ask questions and share cool things you learn with everyone in your group (if applicable)!

**This document assumes you have a basic understanding of Python, calculus, and linear algebra. Be sure to refresh concepts that you don’t know instead of continuing on without understanding.**
