We hope you are excited to learn more about machine learning and its intersection with neuroscience. To get started, check out the [Schedule](schedule.md). **This is where you will have guided content week-to-week**

This course relies heavily on the i2 Megadoc, which can be found here: [i2 Megadoc](megadoc)

Please remember:
- We are all trying to learn, and learn at different speeds.
- This course is somewhat of a commitment. You will get out what you put in
- There are no grades! This is all for your learning alone.

- Be helpful, be kind, and have fun!

What basics you will learn (a more detailed list can be found in the [wiki](wiki.md):
- ML
- DL
- Neuroanatomy
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning
- Movement
- Language Modeling
- AI Fairness/Theory
- Pain in RL/Neuroscience/Cognitive Science
- More about the brain

And also:
