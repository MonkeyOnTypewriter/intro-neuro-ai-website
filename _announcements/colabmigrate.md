title: Migration to Google Colab

**Notebooks in repo soon obsolete**: For ease-of-use and accessibility, we have decided to migrate the `.ipynb` files stored in this repo over to Google Colaboratory. This removes the need to set up
an environment and install Anaconda on your personal machine. Colab has many libraries pre-installed and they can be easily imported without much hassle. As of now, only the Unit 1 notebook has been migrated due to some pending updates. The links should all point to Colab soon though. Cheers!
