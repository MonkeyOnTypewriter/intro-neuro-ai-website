**How to use**: Take a look at the "Schedule" tab to see how UW I2 uses this website/megadoc. You can take our schedule but since we are on a quarter system it has just 10 weeks of content. All you have to do to run a course like this is create a schedule/syllabus like we have, and have someone able to give a lecture each week on the upcoming unit. All learning + projects are contained on this website! Note that there are **two** repos. One of them is the repo that generates this website, and the other is simply a bucket for all the projects that we have in this course.

**How to contribute:** If you wish to add to this repository of knowledge. please consult the wiki tab of this repo: [Website Repository Wiki](https://github.com/interactive-intelligence/intro-neuro-ai-website/wiki)
